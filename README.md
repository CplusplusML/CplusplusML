#C++ML

Most C++ developers go through a modeling phase when creating a program.
Unfortunately, there is currently no tool to illustrate graphically the entire set of concepts present in C++.

It's to solve this problem that we decided to create C++ML.
C++ ML is a modular software that helps you to design and maintain software in C++.
To ensure portability and durability of your designs, it was essential to standardize a graphical modeling language dedicated to C++, our software will implement this language.

To allow the distribution of our solution to the greatest number, our language will be in the public domain and our program will be shared freely under new BSD license.
Moreover, it is scalable with the tools of your choice for editing, compiling and debugging.

It is our goal to change the way of modeling in C++.
