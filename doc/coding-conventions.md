Conventions
===========

Files architecture
------------------

- The project's directories are organized like that :
  ```
  cplusplusml/                # root directory of the project
  -----------/include/        # contain the includes needed to compile the source
  -----------/src/            # contain the source files
  -----------/src/main.cc
  -----------/src/a/          # contain the source files of code inside the namespace ::a
  -----------/src/a/b         # contain the source files of code inside the namespace ::a::b
  -----------/src/cplusplusml # contain the source files of code inside the namespace ::cplusplusml
  -----------/test/           # contain all the unit tests
  -----------/build/          # contain all files and folders generated during the compilation
  -----------/build/dbg       # files and folders generated by compiler with debug options
  -----------/build/release   # files and folders generated by compiler with release options
  ```

- Each sub folder have to contain the content of one namespace.
  > ---
  > <center>__<! WARNING !>__</center>
  >
  > namespace `::cplusplusml` corresponds to folders :
  >  `cplusplusml/include/cplusplusml/` and `cplusplusml/src/cplusplusml/`
  >
  > __NOT__ <s>`cplusplusml/include/`</s> and <s>`cplusplusml/src/cplusplusml/`</s>
  >
  > ---

- Header files have to contain only one class definition (obviously that doesn't aim the nested classes)

- Each source file should have a associated header file (exception : main.cc and test files)

Naming
------

### Files & Folders

- Names of files or folders have to be lowercase with each word separated by underscores.<br/>
  Example: `cplusplusml/include/cplusplusml/nuclear_reactor/combustion_chamber.h`

- C++ source files have as extension `.cc`

- C++ header files have as extension `.h`

- The folders have to be nammed like the namespace in it.<br/>
  Example: definitions inside the namespace `cplusplusml::` are in the folder `cplusplusml/include/cplusplusml` and implementations are in `cplusplusml/src/cplusplusml`

- The files have to be nammed like the class in it.<br/>
  Example: definition of class `::cplusplusml::Arrow` is in `cplusplusml/include/cplusplusml/arrow.h` and its implementation is in `cplusplusml/src/cplusplusml/arrow.cc`

### Namespaces

- Namespaces names have to be lowercase with each word separated by underscores.<br/>
  Example: `::cplusplusml::contraint`

### Types

- Types names have to be upper CamelCase (start by an capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word).<br/>
  Example: `::cplusplusml::Arrow`

### Variables

- Variables names have to be lowercase with underscores separating each word.<br/>
  Example: `int previous_value;`

### Exceptions

- Those conventions could be bypass when you follow an existing naming convention scheme.

Implementation details
----------------------

### Blocks

#### Opening curly bracket postion

##### Rule:

Keep your block opening curly bracket to the line wich define the executing condition of your block :

Examples:
```
  /* The following block will be executed dependently of the previous "if".
  Also, you have to keep your '{' juste after your condition */
  if (1 == 1) {
    // content of your block
  }

  /* The following block is a unconditional block.
  Also, you should put your '{' in a newline */
  {
    // block without executing condition
  }
  ```

### Functions

#### Comments

Put a comment /* */ before your functions declaration to explain what are their inputs and outputs,
what they do and a least one example of their utilisation.

Example:

````
/* Draw a line from point x to point y (included).
  Arguments :
  Coord x: coord of the begining of the line
  Coord y: coord of the end of the line
  Brush brush: brush used to draw the line
  DrawingCallback: callback wich will be executed right after the drawing of the line

  Examples: ```
    // Draw a line from {0, 0} to {10, 10}
    DrawLine({0, 0}, {10, 10}, Pencil(2));

    // Draw a line from {10, 42} to {42, 10} and log it
    DrawLine({10, 42}, {42, 10}, [] (Coord x, Coord y, Brush brush) {
      Log("Draw line from x: % to y: % with brush % (%px)", x, y, brush.Name(), brush.Size()); });
 ```
*/
void DrawLine(Coord x, Coord y, Brush brush);
void DrawLine(Coord x, Coord y, Brush brush, DrawingCallback);
